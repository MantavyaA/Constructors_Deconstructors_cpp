Constructor called for 26/12/2022
Constructor called for 26/12/2022
Constructor called for 26/12/2022
Constructor called for 26/12/2022

Now creating dates inside loop:
Constructor called for 1/1/2025
Destructor called for 1/1/2025
Constructor called for 2/1/2025
Destructor called for 2/1/2025
Constructor called for 3/1/2025
Destructor called for 3/1/2025
Constructor called for 4/1/2025
Destructor called for 4/1/2025

End of program
Destructor called for 26/12/2022
Destructor called for 26/12/2022
Destructor called for 26/12/2022
Destructor called for 26/12/2022
